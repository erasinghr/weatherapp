# weatherapp
Learnt in a course on Udemy by instructor Andrew Mead.
App predicts the weather of location entered in the terminal.
App is based on node.js where we have used postman-request to fetch data.
This file includes my APIs which I used to fetch data from weatherstack to fetch weather and mapbox for longitude and latitude.
This app takes input from terminal.
